# CSU_Algae_Model_Download_Instructions

Downloading the CSU Algae Model is relatively staightforward and can be achieved by following the steps outlined below. However, for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to download and use the model, download and view the "Quick_Start_Guide" above. 

Summary of Model Installation: 
1) Create a folder directly on your C: drive titled "CSU_Open_Source_Algae_Model"
2) Within this folder create two additional folders: "Model_Files" and "Useful_Documents"
3) Retun to the list of repositories on my profile (jonahgreene01) and download the "CSU_Algae_Model_Matlab_Excel_Files" repository
4) Extract the contents of the "CSU_Algae_Model_Matlab_Excel_Files - master.zip" folder to the created "Model_Files" folder. It is important that only the contents of the folder are extracted to the "Model_Files" folder and that an additional file path is not created. 
5) Return to the list of repositories and download both the "CSU_Algae_Model_TMY3_Data_1of2" and "CSU_Algae_Model_TMY3_Data_2of2" repositories and extract the contents of both ZIP folders into the same "Model_Files" folder.
6) Return to the list of repositories and download the "CSU_Algae_Model_Useful_Documents" repository and extract the contents of the folder into the "Useful_Documents" folder createdin Step 2. 
7) Open the recently created "Model_Files" folder and find the Excel file titled "CSU_Algae_Model_User_Interface.xlsm"

The file path should be C:\CSU_Open_Source_Algae_Model\Model_Files\CSU_Algae_Model_User_Interface. Additionally, when opening the "Model_Files" folder you should see all of the TMY3 Datasets, all of the Matlab functions and scripts, and two excel files ("CSU_Algae_Model_User_Interface" and "Growth_Model_Outputs"). You will never need to open or use the "Growth_Model_Outputs" as it is simply an intermediate file used to transfer results between Matlab and Excel. 

8) Once the user interface is open and running, the model should run entirely within Excel and will call upon Matlab internally using VBA commands. 

For details on how to use the model and intepret results, see the "Quick_Start_Guide"
